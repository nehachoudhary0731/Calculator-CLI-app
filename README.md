# Calculator-CLI-app

This project is a basic Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator* developed using Python. It is designed to perform 
fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program accepts input
directly from the command line, making it suitable for automation and quick mathematical calculations.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Understanding of basic Python syntax and functions
- Handling of command-line arguments using the sys module
- Implementation of control flow and error handling

# Tech Stack

- Language*: Python 
- Core Module: sys (for command-line argument handling)  
- Execution: Command-Line Interface (CLI)  
- Environment: Works on all platforms with Python installed  

# Features

- Supports four fundamental operations: add, sub, mul, div
- Accepts multiple numeric inputs for each operation (not limited to two numbers)
- Gracefully handles invalid input such as non-numeric values or division by zero
- Prints informative messages for both correct and incorrect usage
- Implements operations using individual functions for clarity and modularity
- Simple structure suitable for academic assignments and demonstrations

# Example Usage
- python calculator.py add 5 3
- python calculator.py sub 10 4
- python calculator.py mul 2 7
- python calculator.py div 10 2
